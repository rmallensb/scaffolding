## blink.cmp

Alternative to nvm-cmp
Most of the community seems to agree it's better/ faster.

## nvim-tree

WHY IS IT SO SLOW 
see if there is a better alternative
    - don't need anything fancy
    - prefer less functionality and fast
    - (kinda wanna start using it less)

## neogit

neovim version of emac's `magit`
everyone LOVES magit in the emacs community, neogit seems to be getting similar love

## Snacks.nvim zen

replacement for peek? it has other QoL elements to it as well.
